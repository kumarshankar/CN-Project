0,12,Rethinking some of my mascara failures. Yesterday I had on my normal super reliable mascara that I never even think about. At the end of the day it was all over under my eyes. Only thing different was that I had tried a sample of a Fenty beauty foundation- which had a finish I did not care for on my skin. Won't be getting that. Point is that it makes me wonder about ingredients in foundation that may soften or breakdown mascara. Hmm....,0,0,,2017-09-15T13:28:02.000Z

I think it was OLD (that's my theory, anyway) or maybe had been stored weirdly. It had a fishy smell that was overwhelming (I never put it on my eyes so I do not know about the wear time). So, adding in your experience makes me wonder about quality control? Eyeshadow shadow palettes should have a long shelf life, but maybe they are stretching it? At any rate, I exchanged it, and the new one did not have the fishy smell and works well. If you had not had it for so long, I might suggest you exchange it. I am not sure a new purchase is justifiable, but if they send you a new one, give it another shot.",0,0,,2017-09-15T14:43:25.000Z
