# Youtube Comments Classifier
This is a bidirectional LSTM based multi class multi label classifier that classifies youtube comments into 12 useful categories. We also leveraged centrality concepts of complex networks for feature engineering


## Overview
This classifier is trained on manually tagged youtube comments data that was scraped by us. We came up with 12 categories that can broadly categorize the comments


## Motivation
The classifier can be integrated in youtube to help content developers parse through the enormous number of comments they receive on their videos. The content creators can quickly identify those comments that they need to respond to. This will drive more views and higher subscription rate, in turn helping the channel grow


## Dataset
Around 12k comments are scraped using python from youtube videos spanning across different genres
